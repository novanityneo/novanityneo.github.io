    <pre class="lettertext">Happy Birthday Sweetie! You're now officially an adult but you're still my little loser! 18 years ago the world got an amazing, beautiful person. I can never tell you enough how wonderful you are and how much you mean to me. Every time I talk to you, you make me extremely happy. From the moment I've met you, I've cherished every second spent with you. Anyone in this world would be lucky to know you or be in the presence of you. For your birthday, I wanted to write something different than the standard message so instead, I'm going to write 18 reasons why I love you - one for each year you've been alive.

1. You've always been there when I needed you. As a friend and a girlfriend you've always been there for me to cheer me up no matter what. No matter what it is I can count on you to always listen and make me feel happy again. Even when I don't want to talk you do your best and give me space when I need it. I will always appreciate you for this. You can come to me whenever you need something as well.

2. You're not afraid to be you. You're unique and a huge dork. But no matter how shy you are you're still freely weird and I think it's really cute. You never pay attention to how others think about you. You recite quotes from the Grinch because you're insanely obsessed with it. It's cute. In turn, you also deal with how weird I can be.

3. You're fun to be around. Whether we are calling or are actually together, you've given me some of my favorite memories. There's nothing I'd rather be doing than talking to you or even just laying together in silence. You never fail to put a smile on my face whenever I'm with you.

4. You take risks. Being with me at all was a huge risk. You didn't care what your family thought and when your mom said she would take your phone away if you dated another person online. That risk gave me the person I love more than anything. 

5. You make me believe in love. When I met you, I was at a terrible point but being with you made me feel I could I love again. Love has never been something I liked. I always felt it was just another person I could lose and I never wanted that. With you I feel its worth it again. You gave me another chance at love.

6. Your insecurities. No matter what you hate about yourself, it gives me another thing to love even more. I will never get tired of reassuring you of all the amazing things about you.

7. You watch horror movies with me even if you don't like them. You're a little baby and get scared easily but regardless you always watch whatever I want to watch. I'll always be here to protect you; you never have to be scared, baby.

8. We can talk about anything together. We have some of the weirdest conversations and can laugh about it forever. With you everything feels normal.

9. You love everything about me. You always tell me my snoring is cute and tell me that I'm cute. You make me feel a lot better about myself even over stupid stuff.

10. You don't hold anything back. Whenever something is wrong, you open up and tell me what's wrong. You've gone through a lot in the past and you've always told me no matter how bad it is. You're strong enough to get through anything and I will do my best to ensure you  do. 

11. You drop everything for me. Whenever there's something I don't like, you always change that. Even if it's someone I feel has bad intentions. It doesn't come without it's arguments but in the end you do anything for me. You always care about my opinion and listen when you know I'm right. (I'm not always right)

12. 1FBB9. It's been over a year and you never fail to give me that feeling as if we've just met for the first time. It's like falling in love with you all over again. The way you make my heart tingle over even the smallest stuff makes me extremely happy.

13. We almost never argue. Of course arguments are part of a healthy relationship and without them we would never be able to learn more about each other. But we hardly argue and when we do, there's almost always a good reason for it. There's nobody else I would rather have stupid arguments with it. The love afterward makes it worth it.

14. I can't picture my life without you. I never liked looking too far into the future, I like living in the moment. But when I do think about my future you're always there. If I could spend the rest of my life with you, I wouldn't hesitate to. 

15. You always support me. Whenever I create anything, you always tell me you like it or retweet it. You're the reason I will never give up on what I love to do.

16. Your cuddles. Laying with you, cuddling is my favorite thing in the world. I love being super close with you and it makes me feel loved. There's no better feeling in the world. Even when it's extremely hot, I would never pass up your warm, soft cuddles.

17. You've taught me a lot about myself. Throughout the time I've known you, you've helped me grow and mature. Every argument is another lesson on how I can better myself. You indirectly help me grow.

18. You're extremely beautiful. This list is in no particular order and I'd love you no matter how you looked. But you're absolutely beautiful. There's nothing about you that I don't love. Both inside and out you're the most beautiful girl in my eyes. I wouldn't trade you or your love for anything. 

I look forward to the many more memories we will make and although this is only 18 reasons, I can promise you there are a million more reasons why I love you. You're the best thing to happen to me and this world. You're a wonderful person and I'm more than grateful to be part of your life. I love everything about you and I love you with all of my heart. Happy Birthday Baby!</pre>
