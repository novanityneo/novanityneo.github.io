            Happy Valentines Day Baby! I want you to know that no matter how little we've talked lately, I never stop thinking about you once. You're always in my mind and you truly help me get through whatever I'm feeling at the moment. The time that I've spent with you has been the best moments of my life whether it be in person or miles apart. No matter how much time that's passed, I still feel like I'm new to this and I don't truly know what I'm doing, but I'm trying my best to make you as happy as possible. Love is hard, especially not for me, but for you it's truly worth it. I will never doubt the love we have for each other and I can only hope we be together soon. Valentine's day as a long distance couple is never easy, I want to do so much with you and make you feel loved in person but the best I can do right now is reassure you that I love you and I would never give up on you or us. I'm always thinking about how I would love nothing more than to be able to lay besides you again and finally feel like I'm truly home. I've said it so many times but nobody has ever made me as happy as you do and I will always be thankful to have you in my life baby. My friends ask me when or if I'll marry you and it makes me happy because even everyone else can see that we are pretty much inseparable. I couldn't imagine a life without you and all the time it took for me to finally find someone like you was more than worth it. One day we will be together, forever and I can't wait for that day. I want to be able to hug and kiss you whenever and tell you how much I love you, to never let go. Thank you again for all the memories and the many more that will come. I love you with all my heart baby ðŸ’•ðŸ¥°ðŸ¤—ðŸ˜˜
        </p></div>
