        <p class="letter">I'd love nothing more than to have spent today with you but I'm glad to see you had fun anyway! I'm sure I've said it before but I've never really cared for this holiday. But you give me a reason to because I can make things for you to show you that I love you so much. Of course I don't need a special day to tell you I love you, but having a day where I can go above and beyond is great. I'd do so much more to make this day even more special if I were with you. I imagine all the cute dates we could go on and it would just be amazing.</p>
                
        <p class="letter">No matter how long we go without talking, being able to hear your voice again makes me extremely happy. I'm not the best with conversation and a lot of the time I'm tired, but even five minutes with you would be the greatest five minutes of my life. You bring me so much joy and I'm so grateful for you. Not a day goes by where I don't smile because of you. You're still a huge pain in the ass but I love you regardless. I'm grateful for us to have lasted as long as we have and nothing will tear us apart. Putting up with your occasional annoyances is always worth it in the end because we can be happy together. I don't need or expect anything extra, just you. I'll always appreciate you for who you are no matter how much I "bully" you. When I met you I was completely heartbroken and now you've turned my life into something worth living. I can never thank you enough for what you've done for me. I see love in a different way now and that love is all yours. In your own way you're perfect and there's nothing not to love about you.</p> 
                
        <p class="letter" style="color: #EB7EA3;">Thank you for being my valentine this year, I love you so much baby.</p>
                
        <p class="letter" style="color: #EB7EA3;">We'll call soon ‚ù§</p>
